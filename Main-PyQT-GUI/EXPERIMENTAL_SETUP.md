# 3.5.1 Experimental Setup

## Development Environment Configuration

The experimental setup for the secure chat application required careful configuration of multiple software components and libraries to ensure consistent development and testing conditions. The setup process was designed to create a reproducible environment that could be replicated across different machines for collaborative development and validation testing.

## Operating System and Base Requirements

The primary development environment was established on Windows 10 Professional (64-bit) with Python 3.12.0 installed from the official Python.org distribution. Python was configured with PATH environment variables to enable command-line access and proper package management. The installation included pip package manager (version 23.2.1) and setuptools for dependency management.

Visual Studio Code (version 1.84.2) was installed as the primary integrated development environment with the Python extension (v2023.20.0) for enhanced code editing, debugging, and IntelliSense support. The Python extension was configured to use the project-specific virtual environment for proper dependency isolation.

## Virtual Environment Setup

A dedicated Python virtual environment was created to isolate project dependencies and prevent conflicts with system-wide packages. The virtual environment setup process involved the following commands:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify virtual environment activation
python --version
which python
```

The virtual environment was activated before each development session to ensure consistent package versions and dependency resolution. Environment variables were configured to maintain the virtual environment state across terminal sessions.

## Core Package Installation

The primary packages required for the secure chat application were installed using pip with specific version constraints to ensure reproducibility. The installation process followed a systematic approach to handle dependencies and verify successful installation:

```bash
# Install PyQt5 GUI framework
pip install PyQt5==5.15.9

# Install cryptography library for encryption
pip install cryptography==41.0.7

# Install Pillow for image processing in file transfers
pip install Pillow==10.0.1

# Verify installations
pip list
pip show PyQt5 cryptography Pillow
```

Each package installation was verified by importing the modules in Python and checking version compatibility. The cryptography library installation included compilation of native extensions, requiring Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools for proper compilation on Windows systems.

## PyQt5 Configuration and Testing

PyQt5 installation required additional configuration to ensure proper GUI rendering and cross-platform compatibility. The setup included verification of Qt libraries and testing of basic widget functionality:

```python
# Test PyQt5 installation
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QWidget
from PyQt5.QtCore import Qt
import sys

# Create test application
app = QApplication(sys.argv)
window = QWidget()
window.setWindowTitle('PyQt5 Test')
window.show()

# Verify Qt version and capabilities
print(f"Qt version: {Qt.qVersion()}")
print(f"PyQt5 available: {hasattr(Qt, 'QApplication')}")
```

The PyQt5 setup was tested with both windowed and full-screen modes to ensure proper display scaling and event handling across different screen resolutions.

## Cryptography Library Configuration

The cryptography library setup required specific attention to ensure proper compilation and availability of cryptographic primitives. The installation process included verification of FIPS-validated algorithms and performance testing:

```python
# Test cryptography installation
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
import os

# Verify encryption capabilities
key = Fernet.generate_key()
fernet = Fernet(key)
test_message = b"test encryption"
encrypted = fernet.encrypt(test_message)
decrypted = fernet.decrypt(encrypted)

print(f"Encryption test successful: {test_message == decrypted}")
```

Performance benchmarking was conducted to measure encryption and decryption speeds for different message sizes, ensuring acceptable performance for real-time messaging applications.

## Network Configuration and Testing

The experimental setup included configuration of local network settings for client-server testing. Network configuration involved firewall settings, port allocation, and loopback interface testing:

```python
# Test network socket functionality
import socket

# Test TCP socket creation and binding
test_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
test_socket.bind(('localhost', 0))  # Bind to available port
port = test_socket.getsockname()[1]
print(f"Test socket bound to port: {port}")
test_socket.close()
```

Network testing included verification of localhost communication, port availability, and proper socket cleanup to prevent resource leaks during development and testing phases.

## Development Tools Configuration

Git version control was configured with project-specific settings for collaborative development and version tracking:

```bash
# Configure Git for project
git config user.name "Developer Name"
git config user.email "developer@example.com"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

Code formatting and linting tools were configured to maintain consistent code quality throughout the development process. The setup included automatic formatting on save and pre-commit hooks for code validation.

## Testing Environment Preparation

A dedicated testing environment was established to validate application functionality across different scenarios. The testing setup included multiple virtual machines for simulating different network conditions and user interactions:

- **Primary Development Machine**: Windows 10 with full development environment
- **Testing Client**: Separate machine for client application testing
- **Network Isolation Testing**: Virtual network configuration for security testing

Each testing environment maintained identical package versions and configuration settings to ensure consistent behavior across different deployment scenarios.

## Package Dependencies Documentation

All package dependencies were documented in a requirements.txt file for reproducible installations:

```
PyQt5==5.15.9
cryptography==41.0.7
Pillow==10.0.1
```

The requirements file was version-controlled and updated whenever new dependencies were added or existing versions were modified. Dependency pinning ensured consistent behavior across different installation environments.

## Verification and Validation Setup

The experimental setup concluded with comprehensive verification testing to ensure all components functioned correctly together. Integration testing validated the interaction between PyQt5 GUI components, cryptographic functions, and network communication modules.

System resource monitoring was configured to track memory usage, CPU utilization, and network bandwidth during application testing. Performance baselines were established for comparison during optimization phases.
