## üìñ Usage Guide

### Server Administration

1. **Start Server**: Configure host/port, set server password, and click "Start Server"
2. **Password Protection**: Server requires password authentication before allowing connections
3. **Security Dashboard**: Monitor real-time security events, rate limiting, and threat detection
4. **User Management**: View connected users, authentication status, and kick problematic users
5. **Message Monitoring**: View all server communications with security filtering
6. **Security Logs**: Comprehensive audit trail of all security events and threats
7. **Rate Limiting**: Automatic protection against spam and DoS attacks

### Client Usage

1. **Connect**: Enter server details, username, and server password
2. **Authentication**: Complete password challenge to gain access
3. **Send Messages**: Type messages with automatic XSS/threat detection
4. **Share Files**: Click "Share File" to send documents/images (with malware detection)
5. **Security Warnings**: Receive notifications when messages/files are blocked
6. **Download Files**: Received files are automatically saved with security validation
7. **View Users**: See all connected users in the sidebar with authentication status

### Security Features in Action

- **XSS Detection**: Messages containing dangerous content are blocked and warnings are shown
- **Rate Limiting**: Rapid message sending is automatically throttled
- **File Security**: Malicious files are detected and blocked with user notification
- **Authentication**: Password protection prevents unauthorized access
- **Audit Logging**: All security events are logged for monitoring

### File Sharing

- **Supported Types**: Images (PNG, JPG, GIF), Documents (PDF, TXT), Archives (ZIP)
- **Size Limit**: 10MB per file with server-side validation
- **Security Scanning**: Advanced malware detection and file type validation
- **Auto-download**: Files are automatically saved to `received_files/` folder
- **Encryption**: Files are encrypted during transmission with AES-256
- **Server Feedback**: Explicit success/failure notifications for file transfers
- **Architecture**: Server acts as a relay only - files are not stored on the server

### File Sharing Architecture

The application uses a **relay-based file sharing model** for security and efficiency:

#### How File Sharing Works

1. **Client Side (Sender)**:

   - User selects a file to share
   - Client encodes file to base64 and encrypts
   - File data is sent to server with metadata

2. **Server Side (Relay & Security)**:

   - Server validates file size and type for security
   - Advanced malware detection scans file content and metadata
   - Server sends explicit success/failure notifications to sender
   - Server does NOT store the file locally (relay-only architecture)
   - Server immediately relays approved files to all other clients
   - Only validation, security scanning, and relay - no persistent storage

3. **Client Side (Receivers)**:
   - Clients receive the file data from server (only if approved)
   - Clients decode and save file to `received_files/` folder
   - Receive security notifications if files are blocked
   - Each client manages their own file storage with validation

#### Benefits of Relay Architecture

- **Privacy**: Server never stores user files
- **Security**: Advanced malware detection and file validation
- **Storage Efficiency**: Server doesn't need file storage space
- **Attack Surface**: Reduces security risks on server
- **Scalability**: Server memory usage remains constant
- **Simplicity**: No file cleanup or management needed on server
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/failure notifications for all file operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Network Protocol

#### Message Format

```json
{
    "type": "message_type",
    "data": {
        "id": "message_id",
        "sender": "username",
        "content": "message_content",
        "type": "text|file|system",
        "file_data": {...},
        "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp"
    }
}
```

#### Message Types

- `text`: Regular chat message (subject to XSS detection)
- `file`: File sharing message (subject to malware detection)
- `system`: Server notifications and security alerts
- `error`: Error messages and warnings
- `server_message`: Server announcements
- `warning`: Security warnings (XSS/malware detection)
- `file_success`: File transfer confirmation messages
- `auth_challenge`: Password authentication requests
- `auth_response`: Authentication responses

### Data Structures Used

1. **Rate Limiting Queues**: Multi-tier FIFO queues for different operation types (messages, auth, connections)
2. **User Management Dictionary**: Thread-safe HashMap for user lookup and session management
3. **Security Event Lists**: Ordered message history with efficient searching and filtering
4. **Authentication Tracking**: Binary search trees for efficient session validation
5. **Thread-safe Collections**: Concurrent access protection with proper synchronization
6. **File Transfer Tracking**: Dictionary-based tracking of file transfer states and confirmations

4. Kick problematic users with one click
5. Monitor XSS/malware detection events
6. Graceful server shutdown with client notification

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failed**

- Ensure you have the correct server password
- Check if server is configured with password protection
- Verify server is running and accepting connections

**Connection Refused**

- Ensure server is running first
- Check host/port configuration
- Verify firewall settings
- Confirm server password is set correctly

**Security Warnings**

- XSS/dangerous content warnings are normal security features
- File blocking indicates malware detection is working
- Rate limiting messages show DoS protection is active

**Files Not Sharing**

- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Ensure file passes malware detection
- Verify network connectivity
- Check server security logs for rejection reasons

**GUI Not Responding**

- Close and restart application
- Check system resources
- Update Python and PyQt5 dependencies
- Verify no conflicting processes
