## üîí ENCRYPTION & CRYPTOGRAPHY

- **AES-256 Fernet encryption** for all message communications
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **Cryptographic message authentication** prevents tampering
- **End-to-end encryption** for file transfers
- **Salt-based key generation** prevents rainbow table attacks
- **Message integrity verification** ensures data authenticity
- **Secure key exchange** protocols

## ÔøΩ AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL

- **Password-protected server access** with authentication challenges
- **Session-based authentication** system with timeout protection
- **Brute-force protection** with rate limiting on authentication attempts

- **Security event logging** with detailed timestamps and context
- **Real-time threat detection** and automatic response
- **Connection attempt monitoring** with IP tracking
- **Message encryption tracking** for all communications
- **File transfer security validation** with malware scanning results
- **Failed authentication logging** with brute-force detection
- **User action auditing** for compliance and security analysis
- **Security dashboard** with live monitoring capabilities
